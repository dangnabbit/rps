# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a fairly simple game that plays rock, paper, scissors. You can play with someone else, or with the computer. The computer keeps track of your moves in local storage so it can learn from your behavior and anticipate your next move. If you want to clear out history and have the AI start over fresh, delete the `history.txt` file that the game creates.

Requires ruby and very little else. I wrote this with ruby 2.4.2, but it should work on pretty much any ruby >= 2.0.

To run the game:

`./rps.rb`

Unit tests are run with:

`./rps_test.rb`

Have fun!
